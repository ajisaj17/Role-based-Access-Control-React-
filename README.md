- **Role Management**
  - Define and edit roles

  - Clear display of permissions for ease of understanding and modification

- **Login**
  - User authentication with email and password
  - Only active users are allowed to log in
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **React-Bootstrap**: UI component library for building responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Language used for the frontend logic.
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application (Bootstrap is also used for responsive design).
- **Cookies**: Used for maintaining user authentication session.

5. Usage
Login Page: Users can log in using the provided hardcoded email and password.
Admin credentials:
Email: ajdeveloper@gmail.com
Password: admin123
User credentials:
Email: lucky@gmail.com
Password: user123
Admin Panel: Once logged in, users are redirected to the Admin Panel where they can:
Manage users (view, add, delete)
Manage roles (define and assign roles to users)
Assign and modify user permissions based on roles
How It Works
User Management:
Users can be managed through the admin panel. Each user has an associated role, status, and permissions.
Admin can assign roles such as "Admin" and "User" and control whether a user is active or inactive.
Role Management:
Roles define what actions a user can perform, based on the permissions assigned to that role.
Permissions include operations like "Read", "Write", and "Delete". Each role can have multiple permissions, and each user is assigned a role.
Dynamic Permissions:
Permissions can be dynamically assigned and modified through the system, allowing for flexible role-based access control.
